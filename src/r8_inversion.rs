//! R8 inversion pass — skeleton.
//!
//! This module is the entry point for the dex decompile pipeline's R8
//! inversion stage. It recognises the structural source-to-source
//! transformations that R8 / Proguard apply during shrinking +
//! optimization (block outlining, method inlining, `Enum.values()`
//! caching, dead-code elision artifacts, inner-class flattening,
//! …) and inverts them where the bytecode carries enough information
//! to recover semantic identity, or annotates them where the
//! transformation is lossy by construction (e.g. method inlining
//! without an `--mapping-file`).
//!
//! Pipeline placement: this pass runs in `decompile_method` AFTER
//! [`crate::structure::wrap_try_catch`] (so the IR is fully
//! structured) and BEFORE [`crate::sugar::desugar`] (so sugar
//! operates on the post-inversion IR rather than the raw R8 output).
//!
//! # Wave 1A status (this commit)
//!
//! This file is the SKELETON. It publishes:
//!
//! - The [`R8Origin`] annotation type that future recognizer
//!   sub-streams attach to transformed IR nodes.
//! - The [`R8Transform`] enum that names the recognised
//!   transformations. The enum is `#[non_exhaustive]` and currently
//!   has NO variants — Wave 2 sub-streams (`dex-r8-signatures`,
//!   `dex-r8-inner-class-promotion-back`) add variants as their
//!   recognisers land.
//! - The [`apply`] function whose signature mirrors
//!   [`crate::sugar::desugar`]'s shape. The body is a no-op
//!   pass-through today; Wave 2 wires recognisers into it.
//!
//! # Wave 2 contract (forward reference)
//!
//! Recognisers land as additions to:
//!
//! 1. New variants on [`R8Transform`] (this file).
//! 2. New variants on [`crate::structure::Stmt`] that EMBED an
//!    [`R8Origin`] field, OR an `Option<R8Origin>` annotation on
//!    existing variants — Wave 2 picks the cardinality.
//! 3. Recogniser logic in [`apply`] that walks `stmt`, matches a
//!    transformation shape, and rewrites the matched subtree to a
//!    canonical inverted form with an [`R8Origin`] tag.

/// (the typical pattern is a `$VALUES` field on the enum class itself
/// or a synthetic `$cached-values`-style field on a holder). Every
/// subsequent use becomes `sget-object <field>` instead of a fresh
/// `invoke-static <Enum>.values()`.
///
/// This recogniser fires on a method that **reads** such a field. It
/// returns `Some(R8Origin)` when ALL of:
///
/// - The current method has a `code_item` resolvable through
///   `census.method_code_off` (cross-DEX / native / abstract methods
///   are conservatively skipped).
/// - The body contains at least one `sget-object` whose pool index
///   resolves to a field of type `[L<EnumType>;` (array of an enum
///   subtype — `EnumType.superclass == Ljava/lang/Enum;`).
/// - The field's declaring class's `<clinit>` writes the field via
///   the canonical `invoke-static <EnumType>.values()` →
///   `move-result-object` → `sput-object <field>` sequence (with no
///   other writers anywhere in the DEX).
/// - Across the whole DEX, the field is read at ≥ 2 `sget-object`
///   sites (repetition gate — a single read is not a "cached" use,
///   it's just a normal field access).
///
/// On a match, [`R8Origin::synthetic_helper`] carries the
/// `MethodIdx` of the original `Enum.values()` call R8 replaced
/// (the recogniser identifies it from the `<clinit>` write
/// pattern); [`R8Origin::source_pc`] carries the bytecode PC of the
/// first `sget-object` read site in the current method;
/// [`R8Origin::caller_count`] carries the DEX-wide read-site count.
///
/// # Why "synthetic_helper" carries the values() method
///
/// The [`Stmt::OutlinedBlock`] IR variant's `synthetic_target` field
/// is named for block-outlining but semantically means "the
/// `MethodIdx` the R8 transformation referenced as its source". For
/// EnumValuesCached, that source IS `MyEnum.values()` — the call R8
/// replaced with a field read. Reusing the field gives emit a
/// uniform doc-comment shape across all R8 variants without
/// introducing a parallel IR variant.
///
/// # Why this is pure-on-dex (no extra census parameter)
///
/// The recogniser does its own per-method walk over the
/// candidate-field's `<clinit>` and over the DEX-wide read sites.
/// Wave 2A.1 introduced [`TrampolineCensus`] specifically because
/// the BlockOutlined gates need DEX-wide repetition counts of
/// `invoke-static` targets — and those counts are inherently a
/// cross-method aggregation that would be O(N×M) recomputed
/// per-method. Here, the recogniser walks the current method's
/// instructions ONCE looking for `sget-object` and then verifies

/// owner's `<clinit>` length, which is small. The signature stays
